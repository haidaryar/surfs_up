#Oahu Weather in June & December 



##Overview 

As requesed, I did a quick analysis of the recorded temperature data for months of June and December to get a better understanding of how weather is different between the two months. While in mainland USA June is synonymous with summer and December with winter, in Oahu both months have recorded summer temperatures. 



##Results

As indicated in the overview, temperature in Oahu is the same in June and December.  Analysis snapshot below can help us better understand how minimal differences are: 

* Maximum temperature in December is recorded at 83º while it is 85º in June.
* Minimum temperature in June is recorded at 64º while in December it is 56º.
* Average/mean temperature is recorded 71º in December and 74º in June. 



##Summary

Essentially weather in the island of Oahu remains the same during June and December. There are little differences between the recorded maximum and minimum temperatures for the two months. To get a better understanding of what the weather is like I suggest we perform analysis on wind and humidity data for the months in question.
